- 👋 Hi, I’m @Coreypdumais
- 👀 I’m interested in ... learning to code for a number of reasons. Professionally, I'm most interested in data analysis, with an emphasis on python and the associated data science libraries (pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, etc). Casually, I enjoy coding games using engines such as Unity, Unreal Enginge, and gbstudio.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning ... python for data science.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ... anything!
- 📫 How to reach me ... email; Coreypdumais@gmail.com is a good start
